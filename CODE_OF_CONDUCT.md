# Hubeet Open Source Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

At Hubeet, we believe that open-source communities thrive on collaboration, respect, and inclusivity. As contributors and maintainers, we commit to fostering a welcoming and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity, or socioeconomic status.

We pledge to engage with the community in a way that encourages constructive dialogue, professionalism, and mutual support.

## Our Standards

Behaviors that contribute to a positive and collaborative community include:
* Showing empathy and kindness toward others
* Respecting differing opinions, perspectives, and experiences
* Giving and accepting constructive feedback with professionalism
* Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing when necessary, and learning from them
* Prioritizing what benefits the entire community over personal interests

Unacceptable behaviors include:
* The use of sexualized language, imagery, or unwanted advances
* Trolling, insulting remarks, personal attacks, or inflammatory political statements
* Harassment, whether public or private
* Publishing private information (such as email addresses or physical locations) without consent
* Any behavior that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Hubeet's community leaders are responsible for defining and enforcing acceptable behavior. They will take fair and appropriate action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, harmful, or disruptive.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, including discussions, events, and public representation of the project.
